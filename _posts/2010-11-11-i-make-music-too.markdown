### Water of Flint

<div style="width: 50%;">
  <p>
    Here we are, here we are <br>
    It's just like as you are <br>
    When it's about our right <br>
    It doesn't matter anymore <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Poison in water, I'm so sick. I'm tired <br>
    Unhealthy bacterium directly in my veins <br>
    Bloody corruption, discrimination <br>
    People must wake up and just stop your reign <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Water of flint water water of flint<br>
    Water of flint water water of flint<br>
    Water of flint water water of flint<br>
    Your hate of poormen is just gettin higher<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Water of flint water water of flint<br>
    Water of flint water water of flint<br>
    Water of flint water water of flint<br>
    Your hate of poormen is just gettin higher<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    microphone voice :<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    They're just asking for a better life<br>
    Tell me how Flint lives matter for you<br>
    They deserve a better tomorrow<br>
    With no pain, no sorrow<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Men put your hands ups<br>
    Chemical hold up<br>
    It's not a color problem<br>
    But the power you got<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Money's the reason you are dying for<br>
    Forget about their conscience<br>
    There aren't human no more<br>
    bloody corruption, discrimination<br>
    Flint water crisis , shame of a nation.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Water of flint water water of flint<br>
    Water of flint water water of flint<br>
    Water of flint water water of flint<br>
    Your hate of poormen is just gettin higher<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Water of flint water water of flint<br>
    Water of flint water water of flint<br>
    Water of flint water water of flint<br>
    Your hate of poormen is just gettin higher<br>
  </p>
